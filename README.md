### Bookmark Manager ###

For the week of 10/2/2020, we've been tasked with creating a bookmark manager to allow poeple to store their favourite webpages. 

User Stories:
` As an internet user,
So that I can visit my favourite web pages,
I want to be able to store and see these as bookmarks
`

In order to setup the database from scratch you will need to do the following steps:
  1. Connect to psql
  2. Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
  3. Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
  4. Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
